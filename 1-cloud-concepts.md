### Cloud Concept
Identify Cloud Computing benefits,use SHEAD-F:
```
1) Scalability:
       - addition or removal of the resources in an easy and quick way as per demand.
       - Auto-scaling is an approach for scalability depending on your requirement by defining the threshold.
       - horizontal scaling (often referred to as scaling out) and vertical scaling (often referred to as scaling up)
       
2) High availability:
      -  number of VMs that you set up to eventually cover in case one goes down.
      -  resources for backup of load, any issue and health check.
        
3) Elasticity:
     - capacity to dynamically extend or minimize network resources to respond to autonomous working load adjustments and optimize the use of resources. 

4) Agility: 
       Agility is the capability to adapt quickly and efficiently to changes in the business environment. 
       Agility also refers to the ability to quickly develop, test and deploy business-led software applications.
          
5) Disaster Recovery (DR):
       In case of any catastrophic disaster like cyber-attack. There is a plan in DR to recover your business from these critical systems or in normal operation if such an event occurs. 
       DR has designated time to recover and a recovery point
6) Fault Tolerance:
       Fault tolerance gives you zero down time.
       Fault tolerance means that if there is any fault from the Azure side,then it is immediately mitigated by Azure itself.



Don’t confuse fault tolerance with scaling. 
Scaling allows you to react to additional load or resource needs, but it’s always assumed that all the VMs you are using are healthy. 
Fault tolerance happens without any interaction from you, and it’s designed to automatically move you from an unhealthy system to a healthy system if things go wrong.
